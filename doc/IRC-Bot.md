# <a name="about">About</a>

LibreNMS has an easy to use IRC-Interface for basic tasks like viewing last log-entry, current device/port status and such.

By default the IRC-Bot will not start when executed and will return an error until at least `$config['irc_host']` and `$config['irc_port']` has been specified inside `config.php`.

If no channel has been specified with `$config['irc_chan']`, `##librenms` will be used.
The default Nick for the bot is `LibreNMS`.

The Bot will reply the same way it's being called. If you send it the commands via Query, it will respond in the Query. If you send the commands via a Channel, then it will respond in the Channel.

# <a name="examples">Examples</a>

### Server examples:

Unencrypted Connection to `irc.freenode.org`:

```php
   ...
   $config['irc_host'] = "irc.freenode.org";
   $config['irc_port'] = 6667;
   ...
```

SSL-Encrypted Connection to `irc.freenode.org`:

```php
   ...
   $config['irc_host'] = "irc.freenode.org";
   $config['irc_port'] = "+6697";
   ...
```

SSL-Encrypted Connection to `irc.localdomain` with Server-Password and odd port:

```php
   ...
   $config['irc_host'] = "irc.localdomain";
   $config['irc_port'] = "+12345";
   $config['irc_pass'] = "Super Secret Passphrase123";
   ...
```

### Channel notations:

Channels can be defined using Array-Notation like:
```php
   ...
   $config['irc_chan'][] = "#librenms";
   $config['irc_chan'][] = "#otherchan";
   $config['irc_chan'][] = "#noc";
   ...
```
Or using a single string using `,` as delimiter between various channels:
```php
   ...
   $config['irc_chan'] = "#librenms,#otherchan,#noc";
   ...
```

# <a name="extensions">Extensions?!</a>

The bot is coded in a unified way.
This makes writing extensions by far less painfull.
Simply add your `command` to the `$config['irc_external']` directive and create a file called `includes/ircbot/command.inc.php` containing your code.
The string behind the call of `.command` is passed as `$params`.
The user who requested something is accessable via `$this->user`.
Send your reply/ies via `$this->respond($string)`.

A more detailed documentation of the functions and variables available for extensions can be found at [IRC-Bot Extensions](IRC-Bot-Extensions);

Confused? Here an Echo-Example:

File: config.php
```php
   ...
   $config['irc_external'][] = "echo";
   ...
```
File: includes/ircbot/echo.inc.php
```php
   //Prefix everything with `You said: '...'`  and return what was sent.
   if( $this->user['name'] != "root" ) {
      return $this->respond("You said: '".$params."'");
   } else {
      return $this->respond("root shouldn't be online so late!");
   }
```
